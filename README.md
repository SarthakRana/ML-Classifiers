# Dataset
This repo comprises of only one dataset - 'Social_Network_Ads'.Both linear and non-linear classifiers have been applied and the results and visualization of each dataset has been shown in the codes and is used for the all the models.

# Dataset Explanation
This dataset comprises of 400 rows and 5 feature columns. The first column id 'User ID' which shows the user ID's of various users of a social networking app. The second, third and fourth columns are 'Gender', 'Age', 'Estimated Salary' respectively. The fifth column is 'Purchased' which shows whether a user has bought something by seeing and clicking the advertisment on social networking app and this is the target value.The fact that we are classifying the users into user who bought(1) and users who didn't bought(0) makes this a classification problem.
